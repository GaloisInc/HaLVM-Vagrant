# HaLVM Vagrant / Ansible Archive

This repository is designed as a place for storing various vagrant / ansible /
etc. files for working with the HaLVM. We strongly encourage pull requests! We
want the HaLVM to be easy to develop with, wherever you develop your machines.
So if you've got a new box you think would be fun to include, throw it in!
